## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/audit`
Create a new SEO audit.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "report": {
    "id": "...",
    "siteId": "...",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-24T...",
    "score": 85,
    "rawMeta": { ... },
    "checks": { ... },
    "aiAdvice": { ... }
  }
}
```

### GET `/api/reports?url=<url>`
Retrieve all reports for a specific URL.

### GET `/api/report/[id]`
Retrieve a single report by ID.

### POST `/api/export/[id]`
Export a report as Markdown file.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User submits URL via `AuditForm`
2. `/api/audit` endpoint:
   - Fetches page with Playwright (`lib/fetchPage.ts`)
   - Runs SEO checks (`lib/checks.ts`)
   - Calls OpenAI for recommendations (`lib/ai.ts`)
   - Saves report to database (`lib/prisma.ts`)
3. UI displays results with all components
4. History refreshes automatically

### Components
- `AuditForm`: URL input and submission
- `ScoreBadge`: Color-coded score visualization
- `ChecksGrid`: Technical checks display
- `AdvicePanel`: AI recommendations
- `RewriteSuggestions`: Title/meta rewrites with copy buttons
- `HistoryList`: Past audits sidebar
- `CompareDrawer`: Side-by-side report comparison

### Database Schema
```prisma
model Site {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  url       String   @unique
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  reports   Report[]
}

model Report {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  siteId    String
  score     Int
  rawMeta   Json
  checks    Json
  aiAdvice  Json
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  site      Site     @relation(fields: [siteId], references: [id])
}
```

## Design Decisions

### Playwright vs Cheerio
We chose Playwright over static HTML parsing (cheerio) to ensure accurate metadata extraction from modern JavaScript-rendered websites. While this adds 2-5 seconds per audit vs <1 second, it provides reliable results for all sites.

### Browser Lifecycle Management
A singleton browser instance is reused across requests to minimize overhead while ensuring proper cleanup. This balances performance with resource consumption.

### Score Calculation
Simple penalty-based scoring (100 minus 5 per failed check) provides a baseline. The AI also generates its own nuanced score considering context and severity.

### AI Model Selection
GPT-4o-mini offers cost efficiency while providing high-quality SEO recommendations. The structured JSON output with Zod validation ensures data integrity.

## Tradeoffs

- **Performance**: Playwright is slower than static parsing but handles JavaScript-rendered content
- **Resource Usage**: Browser instances consume more memory; consider implementing request queuing for production
- **Deployment**: Requires Playwright browser binaries (Docker or Vercel/Render recommended)
- **No Authentication**: Currently open; add rate limiting or auth for production use
- **No Caching**: Each audit fetches fresh data; could implement short-term caching

## Production Deployment

**ðŸ“˜ See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment guide**

### Recommended Architecture
- **Railway.app**: Hosts Playwright backend (handles audits)
- **Vercel**: Hosts frontend and non-Playwright APIs (fast CDN delivery)
- **Neon**: PostgreSQL database (shared between both)

This split deployment gives you:
- âš¡ Fast frontend on Vercel's CDN
- ðŸŽ­ Reliable Playwright execution on Railway
- ðŸ’° Cost-effective (Railway handles heavy lifting, Vercel serves static content)

### Quick Deploy

1. **Deploy to Railway** (Backend with Playwright)
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Railway auto-detects Dockerfile
   - Add environment variables (DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY)
   - Deploy takes ~5-10 minutes

2. **Deploy to Vercel** (Frontend)
   - Update `vercel.json` with Railway URL
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Add same environment variables
   - Deploy takes ~2-3 minutes

3. **Update vercel.json**
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [{
       "source": "/api/audit",
       "destination": "https://your-app.railway.app/api/audit"
     }]
   }
   ```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.
